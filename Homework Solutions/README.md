# Instructions
1. Register a Github account and email me the account name. I will add you as a project collaborator.
2. Make sure that your solution is correct. If you have any questions, feel free to discuss with me during the office hour.
3. Upload your homework solutions in the "Homework Solutions" folder. Please put all files in a subfolder named "Week x".
  - [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) is a tutorial on how to upload files on the Github website.
  - [Here](https://blog.reviewnb.com/github-jupyter-notebook/) is a tutorial on how to upload files using Git in command-line.
4. Commit your changes to a new branch and start a pull request.
5. I will review your commit and merge the changes to the main branch.

**You still need to submit the solution to Blackboard to receive grades.**
