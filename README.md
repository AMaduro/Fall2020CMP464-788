## Installing Anaconda Python
1. Download <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda Individual Edition</a>. Make sure to choose the correct option based on your operation system. 
2. Start the installer. It is recommended to use a path that does not contain any spaces.
3. After installation, you can create IPython notebooks using **Jupyter Notebook**. 
  - Navigate to a folder in which you want to store .ipynb files.
  - Click "New" -> "Python3" to create a new notebook.
  - Start coding!
There are other useful applications that can be found in **Anaconda Navigator**.

## Download A .ipynb File
1. Open the file on Github
2. Click "Raw"
3. Right click and choose "Save as". In Windows, you need to change the file type to "All Files" and remove `.txt` in the end of file name. Make sure the file extension is `.ipynb`. 

Now the file can be opened using Jupyter Notebook.
